Use Ractive with Urlang
=======================

Ractive is a template-driven UI library.
The simple idea is to give Ractive a template and som data.
Ractive then generates HTML that can replace an existing DOM node.

These examples show how to use the Ractive JS library from Urlang.
Ractive is a lightweight alternative to Angular, React, etc.
The example is based on  http://www.ractivejs.org/60-second-setup
Thanks to Daniel Praeger for the original Racket version.
